    let result = [];
    for (let i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {
        result.push(i + 1);
        if((result[i] % 3 === 0) && (result[i] % 5 === 0)) {
            result[i] = 'FizzBuzz';
        }
        if(result[i] % 3 === 0) {
            result[i] = 'Fizz';
        }
        if(result[i] % 5 === 0) {
            result[i] = 'Buzz';
        }
    }
    return result;
}
